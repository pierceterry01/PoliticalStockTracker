# Outsider Trading
Outsider Trading is a web application where users can copy investments made by politicians. Using the Finnhub Congressional Trades API, the app tracks the stock trades made by both representatives and senators and allows users to mimic their investment strategies. Information such as trade volume, most traded sectors and issuers, total trades made, and more are on display to aid users in identifying trends and making insights. When copying an investment, the user is able to choose the amount to invest, at what value the investment should be closed if reached, and the sectors the investment should be allocated across. It is through these features that Outsider Trading aims to offer a data-driven, insightful platform for making informed investment decisions based on the strategies of those in Washington.
